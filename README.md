# This project shows how to make a storyboard, custom cells for a tableview, how to hook up an action to a button 
using storyboard or code, how to customize UI items in the storyboard from code, etc. 

This is a very simple project that shows you the most commonly used way of doing this - using TableViews. 
I rarely create anything without a tableview or a collectionview, since they just allow you to create
dynamic content that will work on all screen sizes.
